            <p>Hi, my name is Alonso. I'm from Costa Rica, living in Utah. I like playing video games and also going outside to enjoy nature.
               I'm studying software development at BYU-Pathway, and it's very fun.</p>

It is famous for its lush rainforests, volcanoes, and stunning beaches.</p>
