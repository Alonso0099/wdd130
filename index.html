            <p>Hi, my name is Alonso. I'm from Costa Rica, living in Utah. I like playing video games and also going outside to enjoy nature. I'm studying software development at BYU-Pathway, and it's very fun.
                I serve my mission in Quetzaltenango Guatemala and Costa Rica during covid-19 from 2019 to 2021. I hope to graduate in 2026 in computer scince. I've been married from 2024. One of my goals is to grow a bussines 
                where I can offer all my knowledge about software to the customers and offer job for many people. One of my greatest achievments is start the university because when I was younger it was hard to complete my basic
                academic classes, now that I'm studying I feel so grateful, proud and motivated. I know that every person can do whatever they want if is a great porpuse in their lifes. One of my favorites scpritures is "Doctrine and Covenants 130:18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.
                19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." 
                This motivate me every day to learn more and more becasue I had less advantage than others in the past, but I'll have more in the future.  
            </p>
